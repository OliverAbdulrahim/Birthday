# Birthday
A program I made to celebrate someone's birthday!
### How to Run
Download the .jar file from [here](https://github.com/OliverAbdulrahim/Birthday/blob/master/dist/Birthday.jar?raw=true) and run the file (you'll need Java 8 or later for it to work). Or, if you prefer to run from the console, type:

java -jar "<location of Birthday.jar>"
```

# About
I made this program to celebrate someone's birthday. If you like, you can fork this repository, change the [name](https://github.com/OliverAbdulrahim/Birthday/blob/master/src/birthday/EntityConstants.java#L18) and/or [date](https://github.com/OliverAbdulrahim/Birthday/blob/master/src/birthday/EntityConstants.java#L23) at the provided links, and recompile the program to suit your birthday needs. 

### Features
  - Random birthday paraphernalia: 
    - Images of cakes, gifts, and other party-related items bounce around with joy!
  - Click to get more gifts!
    - Left-clicking spawns new gifts to bounce around the screen.
    - Right-clicking removes a random gift from the screen.
    - Middle-click to clear everything.
